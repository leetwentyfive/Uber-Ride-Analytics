# Uber Ride Analytics – Capstone Project

Analyzed 150,000 Uber rides to identify predictors of incomplete rides and rating variances. Built logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models using Python and scikit-learn.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- Google Colab

## Key Outcomes
- Identified top predictors of cancellations
- Explained rating variance using model outputs
- Led a 4-person team through full project lifecycle

## Files
- `` – Data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training
- `model_results.csv` – Summary of model performance (optional)

*Dataset not included due to size/privacy.*
